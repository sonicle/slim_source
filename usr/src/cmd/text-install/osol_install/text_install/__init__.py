'''Set "_" to be the character that flags text that should be
extracted by xgettext for translation"

Set the ESCDELAY environment variable, if it's not yet set
(n)curses will wait ESCDELAY milliseconds after receiving an
ESC key as input before processing the input. It defaults to 1000 ms
(1 sec), which causes function and arrow keys to react very slowly, so
we default to 100 instead. (Settings of '0' interfere with tipline
esc-sequences)
