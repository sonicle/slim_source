# tm_pre_boot_archive_pkg_image_mod

# pkg_image area modifications specific for text installer, to be made before

# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Main
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Perform pkg_image area modifications specific for text install before the
# boot archive is built.  This finalizer script is to be called before the
# boot archive build is complete.
# 
# Args:
#   MFEST_SOCKET: Socket needed to get manifest data via ManifestRead object
#	(not used)
#
#   PKG_IMG_PATH: Package image area
#
#   TMP_DIR: Temporary directory (not used)
#
#   BA_BUILD: Area where boot archive is put together (not used)
#
#   MEDIA_DIR: Area where the media is put (not used)
#
# Of these automatically-passed variables, only the PKG_IMG_PATH is actually
# used.
#
# Note: This assumes pkg_image area is intact.
